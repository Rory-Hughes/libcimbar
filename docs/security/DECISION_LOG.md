# Security Decision Log

Record significant audit and hardening decisions here. Do not silently change a security boundary.

## ADR-LC-001: Freeze the audit baseline

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Use branch `audit-baseline-681e18e` at commit `681e18eb61a059f4a796bc6ef097d24b45c430eb` as the immutable initial reference.
- **Reason:** Findings, benchmarks, and remediation diffs require a stable target.
- **Consequence:** All fixes and scaffolding occur on other branches.

## ADR-LC-002: Treat optical input as hostile network input

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Assume a compromised companion can intentionally generate every frame and transfer sequence.
- **Reason:** The air gap prevents ordinary network connectivity but does not authenticate displayed optical content.
- **Consequence:** All metadata, dimensions, geometry, block identifiers, timing, and output semantics require hostile-input controls.

## ADR-LC-003: Keep libcimbar outside the trusted core

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Run camera and libcimbar processing in an Optical Interface Processor or isolated process with no secrets.
- **Reason:** Image and codec processing is a large attacker-controlled C/C++ surface.
- **Consequence:** Decoder compromise should not directly expose messaging or wallet keys.

## ADR-LC-004: Build a restricted transport profile

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Product integration will use `libcimbar-transport`, not the generic file-transfer application.
- **Reason:** Filenames, generic filesystems, arbitrary image containers, compression, runtime mode selection, and GUI functionality are unnecessary for the secure transport boundary.
- **Consequence:** Compatibility with generic libcimbar file workflows is secondary to attack-surface reduction.

## ADR-LC-005: Secure Core selects resource policy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Object class and maximum size are selected before scanning and cannot be enlarged by optical metadata.
- **Reason:** Metadata-controlled allocation creates denial-of-service and memory-safety risk.
- **Consequence:** Pairing, messaging, wallet, and firmware-update transfers use separate bounded policies.

## ADR-LC-006: One active incoming transfer initially

- **Status:** Accepted for v0.1
- **Decision:** Permit one reconstruction context at a time.
- **Reason:** Multiplexing unauthenticated optical transfers adds state-collision and resource-management complexity without an essential initial use case.
- **Consequence:** New incoming transfers are rejected or require explicit cancellation of the current session.

## ADR-LC-007: No message or wallet decompression in decoder domain

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Remove zstd from the message and wallet product profiles.
- **Reason:** Encrypted content is not meaningfully compressible after encryption, and hostile decompression adds expansion and parser risk.
- **Consequence:** Any optional pre-encryption compression must occur inside the Secure Core under a separate reviewed format.

## ADR-LC-008: No application interpretation at optical boundary

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The decoder returns one bounded opaque byte object only.
- **Reason:** A barcode reconstruction is not proof of message, wallet, or firmware authenticity.
- **Consequence:** The Secure Core copies, authenticates, and parses the object before taking action.
